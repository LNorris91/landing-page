# landing-page
This is my Landing Page project. I hope to showcase my css skills paired with my html skills thus far to create something that isn't too embarrassing. 

Even though it took me all day, I didn't cheat and am proud that I figured out what I did. I look forward to getting more comfortable with writing more efficient code.
